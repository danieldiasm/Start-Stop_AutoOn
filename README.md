# Start-Stop AutoOn
:no_entry: [DEPRECATED] 

This is some of my very first microcontroller projects, it is a Start-Stop Button for carburated and simple cars.
* Engine revs reading
* Start overun protection.

It was, by far some of the projects I've enjoyed the most! Lot of fun...

The code is messy and poorly optimized, no functions at all.

It is here for historical purposes.

* Schematics
* Code
* Pictures

You can even check a video of this thing working right over [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7S6h9v9QTY) and [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdP39N3rrkk)

##Installation

Well, you may not want to know...It may be risky since you have to play with you car engine coil.
For now, I'll not put it over here, since I plan to make a better newer version of it.
